The program will predict the digit content in a image file. You can take a look at digit4.png as an example.
The program uses Tensorflow as well as opencv process image information.
To train your own model, comment out line 14 to 22 and change echos in line 21 to determine how many
times that you want to trains.
Notice that there will be some errors in the model since we cannot garantee 100% accuraccy.
